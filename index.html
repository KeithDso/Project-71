        <p class="list-group=item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >The food oportunities and responsibilities to conider, canteens must be better oraganised and more efficient than the have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meal prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member that accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements that may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key </p>

        <p class="list-group=item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their childs/childrens activities in the school, instantly. Once the student reaches school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of their students absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their class and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts  of their curriculums subjects. As soon as you enter a students Enrollment number or name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible as trhe tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that does students that always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span, just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents  are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in  a confidential manner and reduced costs</p>
